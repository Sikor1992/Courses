Howdy!
My name is Maciej Sikora and I'm from Poland. I'm 32, married, a father of one and a happy dog & hedgehog owner.
I am an ambitious, highly-motivated person, focused on personal development. Learning new things comes easily to me.
I have a very wide range of interests. Focusing on problem solving along with an unconventional way of thinking allows me to think outside the box.
I am looking for a place that will allow me to spread my wings in the IT industry and gain experience.
I have just founded my github (23rd May 2024) and I am going to keep on uploading stuff from my courses and personal projects, so please stay tuned!
